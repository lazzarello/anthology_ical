DESCRIPTION:\n			Forty years in the making\, THE PAINTER SAM FRANCIS is art
 ist Jeffrey Perkins?s lyrical and intimate portrait of a friend\, mentor\, 
 and leading light of American abstract art. The film retraces Francis?s lif
 e and career from his childhood in California to his artistic maturation in
  post-war Paris\, his time spent in Japan\, and his return to the United St
 ates. Hinging on an interview that Perkins conducted with Francis in 1973\,
  as well as extended scenes of the artist at work in the studio\, the film 
 provides deep insight into a man for whom creativity was a powerful life-su
 staining force. Interviews with friends\, family\, and fellow artists ? inc
 luding Ed Ruscha\, James Turrell\, Bruce Conner\, Alfred Leslie\, and other
 s ? illuminate a mysterious and complex personality\, and its reflection in
  a body of work that is simultaneously diverse and singular. For Francis\, 
 art was a path to transcendence\; for Perkins\, Francis was art. The film i
 s a labor of love\, a moving portrait of a man\, and a tribute to the power
  of art.?? ??When Sam Francis said\, ?I paint time?\, this concept could ve
 ry well have been the primary template for the making of this film. When on
 e considers that I started filming Sam Francis in his studio in Santa Monic
 a in 1968\, and that the film was completed in 2008 ? a forty-year life spa
 n ? ?time? must be seen as the best possible metaphor to describe it.?Sam F
 rancis was an abstract painter\, and therefore the dimensions of the subjec
 t do not follow the preconceptions that form our lives\, but rather\, sprea
 d across space and time in certain ways that are not spelled out for us in 
 logic. The very idea of abstract painting was not about logic\; there was a
 n individual anarchy about making truly abstract paintings\, and of course 
 Sam Francis was about that. All I could do in making a film about him was t
 o facilitate the mechanical witness to the act of painting\, and to attempt
  to ?interview? him.? ?J.P.\n

DESCRIPTION:\n			Special thanks to Dylan Skolnick and Brett Sherris (Cinema
  Arts Centre) and Rick Yankowski (Criterion Pictures). SUSPIRIA\, arguably 
 Dario Argento?s masterpiece\, stars Jessica Harper as Suzy Banyon\, a young
  American ballet dancer who arrives at a prestigious European dance academy
  run by Miss Tanner (Alida Valli) and the mysterious Madame Blanc (Joan Ben
 nett in her final performance\, ?cruelly lured out of a serene retirement?\
 , according to Dave Kehr). Following a series of sinister events Suzy disco
 vers that the academy is actually a front for a coven led by a centuries-ol
 d witch\, kept alive by satanic rituals and black magic. An ear-poundingly 
 terrifying soundtrack by Goblin (played at full volume on set to evoke suit
 ably terrified performances from the cast) and Argento?s use of rich colors
  and disturbing imagery add up to a truly nightmarish experience.?This tale
  of witchcraft at a German dance academy is one of the most beautiful\, dre
 am-like horror films ever conceived\, and quite simply the crowning achieve
 ment of?Dario Argento. Based on essays in Thomas DeQuincey?s SUSPIRIA DE PR

DESCRIPTION:\n			Special thanks to Dylan Skolnick and Brett Sherris (Cinema
  Arts Centre) and Rick Yankowski (Criterion Pictures). SUSPIRIA\, arguably 
 Dario Argento?s masterpiece\, stars Jessica Harper as Suzy Banyon\, a young
  American ballet dancer who arrives at a prestigious European dance academy
  run by Miss Tanner (Alida Valli) and the mysterious Madame Blanc (Joan Ben
 nett in her final performance\, ?cruelly lured out of a serene retirement?\
 , according to Dave Kehr). Following a series of sinister events Suzy disco
 vers that the academy is actually a front for a coven led by a centuries-ol
 d witch\, kept alive by satanic rituals and black magic. An ear-poundingly 
 terrifying soundtrack by Goblin (played at full volume on set to evoke suit

DESCRIPTION:\n			Director in person!?Bizri?s diverse background (born in Le
 banon\, he grew up during the civil war\, and has been a U.S. resident for 
 over two decades)\, and his wide interests in literature and art as well as
  cinema\, are reflected in his own films and videos. Though he has made nar
 ratives\, some of his recent films are specifically inspired by avant-garde
  cinema?. Though respectful of their influences\, ranging from Joseph Corne
 ll to Peter Kubelka\, they also introduce into the well-established grammar
  of avant-garde filmmaking a new feeling of displacement\, with partly fami
 liar editing tropes now unmoored from the kinds of specific (even if multip
 le and ambiguous) meanings familiar from classical avant-garde filmmaking. 
 A new voice has entered cinema?s long dialogue\, one aware of how profoundl
 y dislocated our modern world is.? ?Fred CamperASMAHAN (2005\, 21 minutes\,
  35mm-to-video\, b&w)?Reediting a 1944 Egyptian film starring [a] liberated
 -for-her-era Syrian actress-singer to center his 21-minute film poem around
  her\, Bizri replaces the original narrative with sequences that show her g
 estures\, or suggest the actress?s life. ? Bizri?s work is an obsessive fev
 er-dream not of a movie narrative but of an actress?s presence\; as in his 
 great predecessor\, Joseph Cornell?s ROSE HOBART\, his actress is presented
  as a world in herself\, with a cosmos of both varied emotions and varying 
 degrees of inscrutability contained in her face.? ?Fred CamperVERTICES: BEI
 RUT-DUBLIN-SEOUL (2003-2005\, 32 minutes\, video\, color/b&w)A video for th
 ree screens capturing fragments of a day in the life of each city. Simple s
 cenes from everyday life are recorded with a video camera\, following in th
 e tradition of the documentaries of the Lumi?re films. Each shot lasts 50 s
 econds\, the approximate time a film reel lasted in early cinema. Although 
 the succession of ?cinematic? images enforces this objectivity as they reco
 rd different units of perception\, placing the images in a triptych creates
  a landscape that is entirely subjective\, existing for the viewer as objec
 ts of contemplation.SONG FOR THE DEAF EAR (2008\, 18 minutes\, 35mm/16mm/Su
 per-8mm/HD\, color/b&w)A film poem about the insanity of war and violence i
 n Lebanon. The filmmaker returned to Lebanon in 2007 to create a film on th
 e death of his neighbors some 20 years ago. He constructed a story that rev
 olves around a man who was shot dead on the streets of Beirut during the ci
 vil war and the crumbling world surrounding him.Total running time: ca. 75 
 minutes.\n

DESCRIPTION:\n			Anthology is thrilled to reintroduce the short films of Ma
 deleine Gekiere. Primarily active as a filmmaker from the 1970s through the
  early 80s\, Gekiere came to cinema from a long and distinguished career in
  painting\, drawing\, and assemblage. She produced around 20 different film
 s on Super-8mm and 16mm\, many of which were made as animations on an optic
 al printer. In program notes written for a screening at the Collective for 
 Living Cinema\, Gekiere commented ?My early films were almost exclusively c
 oncerned with transformation and definition of form\, space\, and color. My
  newer films are looking for an inner cohesion that will define the film as
  a unified whole beyond its visual concerns.? Her examination of structure 
 and sound/image relationship demonstrates a deep understanding of screen ti
 me and space\, while her playful attention to motion is at times subtle or 
 else wonderfully exaggerated. These very special films are consistently ent
 ertaining and ripe for rediscovery.Tonight we are lucky to have Madeleine o
 n hand to celebrate her earlier works and to introduce a new video flip-boo
 k of her remarkable and often surprising sketch books.Filmmaker and long-ti
 me friend J.J. Murphy will be present as well\, for a conversation with the
  artist after the show.THREE ACCELERATIONS (1979\, 10 minutes\, 16mm)CANAL

DESCRIPTION:\n			Anthology is thrilled to present encore screenings of the 
 newly-restored and re-discovered THE EXILES. This remarkable film\, re-rele
 ased last year after decades of neglect\, chronicles a day in the life of a
  group of twenty-something Native Americans living in Los Angeles?s now-van
 ished Bunker Hill district.Gritty\, realistic and far ahead of its time (in
  a period when Hollywood films still featured Noble Savages)\, the script f
 or THE EXILES was created exclusively from recorded interviews with the par
 ticipants and with their ongoing input during filming. Native American writ
 ers and activists have long considered THE EXILES as one of the first works
  of art to portray modern Native American life honestly and as an important
  forerunner to the cultural renaissance of American Indian fiction\, poetry
 \, filmmaking\, and theater that began to emerge in the 1970s.?Surprisingly
  enthralling and breathtakingly gorgeous\, it?s almost astonishing that thi
 s find languished in the archives for so long.? ?Sara Cardace\, NEW YORK MA
 GAZINE?Miraculous...a Pilgrim?s Progress of three characters through a nigh
 t of urban loneliness and dissipation\, [THE EXILES] has an epic grandeur a
 nd a monumental intimacy?. The night photography alone would make the film 
 immortal. Few directors in the history of cinema have so skillfully and dee
 ply joined a sense of place with the subtle flux of inner life.? ?Richard B
 rody\, THE NEW YORKER?THE EXILES is haunted by absence. The nonprofessional
  performers are suddenly present again\, telling their stories and acting o
 ut their daily lives. The bars\, shops and tenements of Bunker Hill have on
 ce more sprung into view\, in glistening\, nocturnal\, black-and-white cine
 matography. It?s as if someone had done a ghost dance and it worked\, just 
 a little ? enough to turn your sigh into a gasp of amazement.? ?Stuart Klaw
